# SecureShield-Fortifying-Your-Digital-Perimeter
This code has been developed to address the vulnerability associated with an exposed port, which could potentially serve as an entry point for malicious attacks. For illustrative purposes, consider the scenario where port 6***1 is left open and responds to SYN scans. The presence of this vulnerability could potentially be exploited through techniques such as traversal attacks, which emphasize the significance of securing the affected port to prevent unauthorized access and mitigate potential risks to system integrity.
